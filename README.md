# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

## 1. Introduction

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks designed specifically for processing
sequential data. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process sequences of
inputs.

## 2. Key Concepts

### 2.1 Sequential Data Processing

### 2.2 Basic RNN Architecture

The fundamental RNN equation:

```textmate
ht = tanh(Whh * ht-1 + Wxh * xt + bh)
yt = Why * ht + by
```

Where:

- ht: Hidden state at time t
- xt: Input at time t
- yt: Output at time t
- W: Weight matrices

```textmate
L = Σ Lt(yt, yt_target)
```

Where:

### 4.2 Gradient Problems

#### Vanishing Gradients

- Problem: Gradients become extremely small as they're propagated back through time
- Caused by repeated multiplication of small numbers
- Makes learning long-term dependencies difficult

#### Exploding Gradients

- Problem: Gradients become extremely large
- Solution: Gradient clipping

```textmate
if ||gradient|| > threshold:
    gradient = (threshold * gradient) / ||gradient||
```

## 5. Advanced RNN Architectures

it = σ(Wi · [ht-1, xt] + bi)
c̃t = tanh(Wc · [ht-1, xt] + bc)
ct = ft * ct-1 + it * c̃t
ot = σ(Wo · [ht-1, xt] + bo)
ht = ot * tanh(ct)
```

Where:

## Summary

RNNs are powerful architectures for sequential data processing, with various specialized versions (LSTM, GRU) addressing
specific challenges. Understanding their mathematics, architecture, and practical implementation is crucial for
successful applications in real-world problems.

As mentioned in this video, RNNs have a key flaw, as capturing relationships that span more than 8 or 10 steps back is
practically impossible. This flaw stems from the "vanishing gradient" problem in which the contribution of information
decays geometrically over time.

As you may recall, while training our network, we use backpropagation. In the backpropagation process, we adjust our
weight matrices using a gradient. In the process, gradients are calculated by continuous multiplications of derivatives.
The value of these derivatives may be so small that these continuous multiplications may cause the gradient to
practically "vanish." LSTM is one option to overcome the Vanishing Gradient problem in RNNs.

As mentioned in the video, Long Short-Term Memory Cells (LSTMs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) give a solution to the
vanishing gradient problem by helping us apply networks that have temporal dependencies.

# Understanding LSTM and GRU

## What's the Problem They Solve?

Imagine you're reading a book. By the time you reach page 100, you might forget some details from page 1. Regular RNNs
have this same problem - they struggle to remember information from far back. LSTM and GRU are like giving our neural
network a notepad to write down important things to remember.

## Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Think of LSTM as a smart safe box with three keys:

1. **Forget Gate** (First Key)
    - Decides what to throw away
    - Like cleaning your room: "Do I still need this?"

2. **Input Gate** (Second Key)
    - Decides what new information to save
    - Like taking notes: "This is important, let me write it down"

3. **Output Gate** (Third Key)
    - Decides what to share/use
    - Like deciding what to tell someone: "From everything I know, here's what's relevant"

### Real-world Analogy

Imagine you're watching a TV series:

- Forget Gate: Forgetting irrelevant subplots
- Input Gate: Remembering major plot points
- Output Gate: Deciding what to tell your friend about the show

## Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

GRU is like LSTM's younger sibling - simpler but still effective. Instead of three keys, it has two:

1. **Update Gate**
    - Decides how much of the old information to keep
    - Like updating your to-do list: combining old and new tasks

2. **Reset Gate**
    - Decides how much past information to forget
    - Like starting a new page in your notebook

### Real-world Analogy

Think of it as taking notes in class:

- Update Gate: Deciding whether to add to your existing notes or start fresh
- Reset Gate: Choosing when to start a new topic

## When to Use Which?

### Use LSTM When:

- You need to remember things for a very long time
- You have lots of computing power
- Your task is complex (like language translation)

### Use GRU When:

- You need something simpler and faster
- You have limited computing resources
- Your task is relatively straightforward

## Simple Example in Code

```textmate
# Simple LSTM-like pseudocode
def LSTM(input):
    forget = decide_what_to_forget(input)
    store = decide_what_to_store(input)
    output = decide_what_to_output(input)
    
    memory = update_memory(forget, store)
    return output_filtered_memory(memory, output)

# Simple GRU-like pseudocode
def GRU(input):
    update = decide_update_level(input)
    reset = decide_reset_level(input)
    
    new_memory = combine_memory(update, reset, input)
    return new_memory
```

## Practical Applications

1. **Text Generation**
    - Writing assistant
    - Auto-completion

2. **Translation**
    - Google Translate
    - Real-time translation apps

3. **Speech Recognition**
    - Siri
    - Alexa

4. **Music Generation**
    - Creating melodies
    - Continuing musical patterns

# Technical Deep-Dive into LSTM and GRU

## Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

LSTMs revolutionized sequence modeling by introducing a sophisticated gating mechanism that controls information flow
through the network. The architecture maintains two states: a cell state (Ct) that acts as a memory conveyor belt, and a
hidden state (ht) that functions as the working memory. The cell state is regulated by three gates - forget gate (ft),
input gate (it), and output gate (ot), each implemented as a sigmoid neural network layer. These gates produce values
between 0 and 1, determining how much information should flow through. The forget gate examines the previous hidden
state (ht-1) and current input (xt) to decide what information to discard from the cell state, while the input gate
determines what new information should be stored.

The LSTM's power lies in its ability to maintain constant error flow through its constant error carousel (CEC),
effectively addressing the vanishing gradient problem. When the forget gate is open (close to 1) and the input gate is
closed (close to 0), the cell state maintains its values without degradation, allowing the network to preserve
information over hundreds or even thousands of time steps. The key equation governing the cell state update is Ct = ft *
Ct-1 + it * C̃t, where C̃t is the candidate cell state computed using a tanh layer. This multiplicative gating mechanism
allows for precise control over the memory content, making LSTMs particularly effective for tasks requiring long-term
dependencies like machine translation or complex sequence generation.

## Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

GRUs represent a streamlined alternative to LSTMs, combining the forget and input gates into a single "update gate" and
merging the cell state and hidden state. The update gate (zt) determines how much of the previous hidden state should be
retained versus how much of the new candidate state should be used. This is complemented by a reset gate (rt) that
controls access to the previous hidden state when computing the new candidate state. The mathematical elegance of GRUs
lies in their ability to achieve similar performance to LSTMs with fewer parameters and simpler computation.

The core innovation of GRUs is their interpolation mechanism for updating the hidden state: ht = (1 - zt) * ht-1 + zt *
h̃t, where h̃t is the candidate activation. This formulation ensures that the network can effectively learn to keep
existing information or replace it with new content. The reset gate operates earlier in the pipeline, controlling how
much of the previous state contributes to the candidate activation, allowing the network to effectively "forget" when
needed. This architecture makes GRUs particularly efficient at capturing medium-range dependencies while being
computationally less intensive than LSTMs, making them an attractive choice for many practical applications where
computational resources are constrained.

Both architectures represent significant advancements in sequence modeling, with the choice between them often depending
on specific task requirements and computational constraints. I can provide more detailed mathematical formulations or
specific implementation examples if you're interested.
